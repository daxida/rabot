Language Transfer is an audio series that teaches the basics of Modern Greek in a natural and easy-to-comprehend manner. It focuses on grammar and teaches useful vocabulary to prepare you for everyday conversations.

It's highly encouraged to check it out, as it will help you build a very solid foundation to communicate in Greek.
The complete series can be found on:

- [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/languagetransfer/sets/complete-greek-more-audios)

The audio series follows the teacher (Mihalis) as he teaches a student useful grammatical constructions and how to form sentences naturally, allowing you to follow along by putting yourself in the studentâ€™s shoes.
